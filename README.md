# Online Shop - Fullstack Learning Project

This project is a simple online web shop application built as a part of my journey to learn fullstack development. The goal of this project is to apply my learning through practical experience while building a working web application.

## About This Project

Before starting this project, I had very limited experience with JavaScript and no experience with frameworks like React and Next.js, nor did I have any experience with SQL. However, I have worked quite a bit with Java, especially in backend development, but not in the context of web applications. I aim to extend my knowledge with a project-based learning attempt. 

Through this project, I aimed to learn:
- **Frontend Development**: Building a user-friendly interface using React/Next.js.
- **Backend Development**: Managing data with a backend framework (Java Spring Boot) and handling server-side logic.
- **SQL**: Storing and retrieving data from a relational database.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Display a list of products, including their details such as name, category, price, quantity, and an image URL.
- **Product Details Page**: View individual product details with the option to add items to the cart.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the cart, view the cart contents, and proceed to checkout.
- **SQL Database Integration**: The application uses an SQL database to manage product data and user information.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - React
  - Next.js
- **Backend**:
  - Java Spring Boot (handles server-side logic and RESTful APIs)
  - Node.js (used in React and Next.js development)
- **Database**: MySQL (for managing product and user data)
- **Authentication**: (If applicable, you can mention any authentication method used like JWT or session-based authentication.)
